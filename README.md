Hello.

Thank you for downloading this font. I re-edit these by downloading old font file pack from any other websites for copying it to the right unicode point.

Helvetica
---------

With the name Helvetica (Latin for Swiss), this font has the objective and functional style which was associated with Swiss typography in the 1950s and 1960s.
It is perfect for international correspondence: no ornament, no emotion, just clear presentation of information. Helvetica is still one of the best selling sans-serif fonts.
